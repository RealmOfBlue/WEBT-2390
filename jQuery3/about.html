    <h3> HOW WE STARTED</h3>
    <p>
        Billy Macs Burgers and Rings began as a dream shared by the MacIntyre family. 
        It all started with Billy MacIntyre's passion for crafting the perfect burger 
        recipe, inspired by his love for 80s arcade culture. 
        With the support of his wife, Sarah, and their children, 
        the idea of a family-owned restaurant blossomed into reality. 
        Starting from humble beginnings in a small kitchen, 
        Billy perfected his burger creations, infusing each patty with a blend of 
        flavors that soon became the talk of the town. As word spread about the 
        mouthwatering burgers and the lively arcade atmosphere, Billy Macs Burgers 
        and Rings quickly grew into the beloved establishment it is today. 
        
    </p>
    <p>
        Our journey from a family's culinary vision to a thriving restaurant chain 
        is a testament to our dedication to quality, creativity, and the joy of 
        bringing people together over delicious food and nostalgic fun.
